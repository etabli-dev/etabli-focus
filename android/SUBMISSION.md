# Établi Focus — Android submission checklist

This guide describes the current source and release prerequisites. Observed build
and test results are recorded in [the refinement record](../docs/refinement-2026-10.md).
Compilation, local installation and Google Play acceptance are separate checks.

## Toolchain and build outputs

Use JDK 17, Android SDK Platform 36 and Build Tools 35.0.0. Set `JAVA_HOME` and
`ANDROID_HOME`; the pinned wrapper supplies Gradle 8.13 with AGP 8.13.2. The app
compiles and targets API 36 and supports API 26+. As checked on 2026-11-02, API 36
meets the [Google Play target requirement for new apps and updates](https://developer.android.com/google/play/requirements/target-sdk);
check the requirement again at submission time.

From the repository root:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew --no-daemon testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleDebug bundleRelease
```

| Output | Identity and signing |
|---|---|
| `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk` | Android debug signing; ID `com.raban.etabli.focus.debug`, separate from release data. |
| `app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` | ID `com.raban.etabli.focus`; R8 and resource shrinking enabled. Unsigned unless private release signing is configured. |

An unsigned AAB is a review artifact, not a Play upload. Output existence alone
does not establish signing, device behavior or store readiness.

## Private release signing

`app/build.gradle.kts` optionally reads `android/keystore.properties`. A `storeFile`
entry enables release signing; `storePassword`, `keyAlias` and `keyPassword` must
match the private keystore. Relative `storeFile` paths resolve from `android/`;
an absolute path outside the checkout also works. Without that configuration,
release builds remain unsigned. A configured missing or invalid key fails the
build rather than silently producing a signed release.

No particular keystore, alias or password is assumed to exist. Use the upload
identity registered for this application, or establish one for a new application.
Preserve existing keys, certificates and backups; do not replace a key merely to
follow this guide. The repository ignores `keystore.properties`, `*.jks` and
`*.keystore`; keep credentials and key backups private.

[Play App Signing](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing)
separates the upload key from the app signing key used for distributed APKs.
Configure it for bundle distribution and verify the upload certificate before
uploading. A lost upload key can be reset through Play's process; losing an
unmanaged app signing key has different consequences for updates. A debug key is
not the release upload identity.

## Implemented Android scope

- Core focus/break timer with pause/resume, weekly targets and local history.
- Room history and DataStore timer preferences, with preserving migrations and stable persisted enum names.
- AlarmManager completion notifications and restoration of an active alarm after reboot.
- Kotlin 1.9.24, Compose, edge-to-edge layout and persisted Auto/Light/Dark themes.

## Timer and notification permissions

The manifest follows the [documented exact-alarm permission split](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#USE_EXACT_ALARM):

| Android version | Exact-alarm behavior |
|---|---|
| API 26–30 | `AlarmManager.setExact` does not require either newer exact-alarm permission. |
| API 31–32 | `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` special access applies; the declaration ends at `maxSdkVersion="32"`. |
| API 33+ | `USE_EXACT_ALARM` applies to the core timer and is automatically granted, independently of notification consent. |

`NotificationScheduler` retains its inexact fallback if exact scheduling throws
`SecurityException`. The current UI does not open a special-access request screen
for exact alarms. On API 33+ it separately requests `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`; denying
that permission suppresses notifications without granting or revoking exact-alarm
access. `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED` lets the receiver restore an active timer's alarm.

[Google Play's exact-alarm policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/16558241?hl=en)
recognizes core alarm/timer functionality, but use of `USE_EXACT_ALARM` is reviewed.
Describe the implemented timer accurately in the listing and permission declaration;
a user gesture alone does not establish store acceptance.

## Device and release review

From `android/`, install the debug artifact on a designated test device without
clearing existing app data:

```sh
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.raban.etabli.focus.debug/com.raban.etabli.focus.MainActivity
```

For the minified bundle, use [Android Studio or bundletool](https://developer.android.com/tools/bundletool)
to generate and install a test APK set with an explicitly chosen signing identity.
Without signing options, bundletool may use a debug key; this does not validate the
Play upload certificate. Keep test installs separate from any production release
whose data and signing identity must be preserved.

- [ ] Run tests, lint and debug/release packaging for the exact candidate commit; retain results and artifact hashes.
- [ ] Inspect the final APK/AAB manifest and verify minimum/target SDK, requested permissions, signatures and native-library/ZIP alignment. Keep 16 KiB-device execution separate from static alignment checks.
- [ ] Exercise start, pause, resume, cancel, completion/history, weekly targets, rotation, large text and accessibility.
- [ ] Test notification denial and granted delivery on API 33+, exact-access fallback on API 31/32, background/doze, reboot, force-stop and reopening. Do not expect force-stopped applications to deliver normally.
- [ ] Validate an installed upgrade from existing Room data and timer preferences without deleting history; test backup/restore separately.
- [ ] Configure and verify the private upload key, Play App Signing, release version code and recovery backups. Generate and inspect the signed release candidate.
- [ ] Provide a working privacy-policy URL and in-app policy access. Complete [Data safety and SDK review](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10144311?hl=en) against the actual artifact. Local timer/history data and platform backups must be described accurately. Do not substitute a blanket “no third-party SDKs” assertion.
- [ ] Prepare listing text, icon, feature graphic and screenshots of the current app. Complete content rating, accurate target audience, app category, advertising declaration, pricing and distribution in Play Console.
- [ ] Complete applicable permission declarations and account-specific testing/release requirements. Validate the signed candidate on an internal test track before requesting production rollout.

Publishing source or documentation does not publish an Android app. A signed
release, Play upload, policy approval and production rollout require their own
recorded outcomes.
